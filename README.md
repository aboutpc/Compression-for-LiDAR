# Compression-for-LiDAR

## demo
We support demo of the pretrained model, for simplicity, it is deployed in ipynb file.

## recovery
The process of point cloud recovery during the training of model is illustrated:

![process of recovery](https://github.com/aboutpc/Compression-for-LiDAR/blob/main/fig/recovery.png)

The point cloud will be gradually recovered from the edge contour to the interior detail.

This process will provide some inspirations.

Note that the value of loss in the figure will be different in different training configuration.
